Airbnb Clone Project
Overview
This project is a full-stack Airbnb clone that simulates a real-world booking platform. It emphasizes backend architecture, database design, API security, CI/CD integration, and team collaboration.

Goals
Database Administrator
Designs the relational database schema and manages data integrity using MySQL.

DevOps Engineer
Implements CI/CD pipelines, manages Docker containers, and handles deployment.

Security Engineer
Ensures that all APIs are secure, implements authentication/authorization.

Project Manager
Coordinates team activities, sets deadlines, and ensures project requirements are met.

Technology Stack
Django: A high-level Python web framework used to build RESTful APIs and manage backend logic.
MySQL: A relational database system for storing users, properties, bookings, etc.
GraphQL: A query language for APIs that provides flexibility in fetching nested data.
Docker: Used to containerize the application for consistent development and deployment.
GitHub Actions: Automates CI/CD workflows such as testing and deployment.

Feature Breakdown
User Management
Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.

Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings with photos and pricing.

Booking System
Users can search for properties, view availability, and make bookings.

Review System
After stays, users can leave ratings and comments on properties.

Payment Integration
Users can securely make payments for their bookings.

API Security
Key Security Measures:
Authentication: Verifies user identity using JWT tokens.
Authorization: Ensures users can only access resources they own.
Rate Limiting: Prevents abuse and DDoS attacks by limiting API requests.
Data Validation: Ensures that input is properly sanitized and validated.
Importance:
Protecting User Data: Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information.
Securing Payments: Safeguards financial transactions.
Maintaining Trust: Security fosters user confidence and legal compliance.
CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It automates testing and deployment to ensure faster, error-free releases.

Tools:
GitHub Actions: Automates testing, linting, and deployment when changes are pushed.
Docker: Ensures consistent environments across development and production.
Docker Hub / GitHub Packages: For image storage and versioning.
This pipeline helps in faster development, reduced bugs, and seamless deployment.
